        <h1>Relentless Overdoses in the U.S. </h1>

        <p class="dek">As drug overdoses surge across the United States, communities grapple with the devastating toll of addiction and overdose deaths amidst a landscape strained by limited resources and escalating substance abuse.</p>

        <p>The data was first accessed on March 13, 2024, it comes from the National Institute on Drug Abuse but was originally compiled by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and National Center for Health Statistics The data covers drug overdose deaths of individual drug types and drug categories from 1999 through 2021 across the United States.</p>


        <p>For nearly 30 years, the drug overdose epidemic has been a major issue in the United States. Every year since 1999, the number of overdose deaths have only increased.</p>

        <p>Depressant drugs are characterized by their ability to slow down the central nervous system, offer a seductive escape from life's stresses. However, this sedation can swiftly transform into a deadly embrace when abused. According to the CDC, opioids were involved in over 70% of all drug overdose deaths in the United States in recent years.</p>

        <p>Opioids are responsible for the largest number of overdose fatalities over the past 20 years in the United States. A few examples of opioids include oxycodone and hydrocodone commonly known as painkillers. What causes such a mass amount of overdose death from opioids are the substances within that are unknown to the user. Many opioids have been mass produced to be laced with other dangerous substances like fentanyl.</p>

         <p>"I have dealt with many patients who overdosed on fentanyl, in today’s climate it is commonly laced into pain killers which makes it incredibly cheap to manufacture. Thankfully there are remedies like Narcan which save many people’s lives," said <a href="https://health.usnews.com/doctors/stephen-olexo-195729">Dr. Steve Olexo</a>, a pulmonologist who practices at Luminis Health Anne Arundel Medical Center in Maryland who works in the Intensive Care Unit.</p>

        <p>“Opioids are extremely dangerous, but one also has to be aware of benzodiazepines, which have trickier reversal properties as opposed to a substance like fentanyl. A person’s heart rate can slow down to two beats a minute and be completely unresponsive,” said Dr. Olexo. This class of drugs are sedatives, a common form of medication with brand names like Valium and Xanax. Even though benzodiazepines may be viewed as a “safer” drug type due to common medical prescription from doctors, one can still easily overdose. 

            <p>Heroin, another well-known street drug has actaully been one of the few drugs in the U.S. that has decreased in overdose deaths since 2015. Heroin is derived from the drug morphine which is highly addictive. However, heroin is somewhat unique in how its users develop a tolerance the longer they abuse the drug. With tolerance people are less likely to overdose, which contributes to its low overdose death numbers.</p>

        <p>Stimulants are a fatal surge on the opposite end of the spectrum, stimulant drugs exert their effects by increasing neurotransmitter activity in the brain, producing euphoria, heightened alertness, and increased energy. However, this surge in physiological arousal comes at a grave cost when abused beyond moderation.</p>


        <p>Meth and Cocaine have a well-known history in the United States, as they are known to be the most punishable by law if one illegally possesses either substance. Both have been perceived as “street drugs” and have also increased in overdose deaths since the early 2000s.</p>

        <p>In the United States, drug overdose deaths exhibit notable gender disparities, with males disproportionately affected compared to females. While both genders face the consequences of substance abuse, males experience significantly higher rates of fatal overdoses, reflecting complex societal, biological, and behavioral factors influencing drug use patterns and access to treatment.</p>

        <p>In regard to opioid overdose deaths, males have nearly doubled females in fatalities every year for the last 20 years. The overwhelming numbers are skewed toward males in almost nearly every drug type. </p>

        <p>The trajectory of drug overdose deaths in the United States remains a critical concern as the country moves forward. With the latest data revealing alarming trends spanning over two decades, the urgency for effective interventions and comprehensive strategies to combat this epidemic is more pressing than ever.</p>

        <p>Moreover, the disparities observed in overdose fatalities, particularly with males bearing a disproportionate burden, underscore the need for tailored approaches that account for the diverse socio-cultural and biological factors influencing drug use patterns. As we navigate the challenges ahead, it is imperative that policymakers, healthcare professionals, and communities alike collaborate synergistically to enact meaningful change and safeguard the well-being of individuals across the nation.</p>
